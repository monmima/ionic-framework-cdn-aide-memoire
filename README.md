# Ionic Framework aide-mémoire

The starting point for this project is a fork of [hasanadiguzel](https://github.com/hasanadiguzel)'s [ionicCDNExample](https://github.com/hasanadiguzel/ionicCDNExample). Thank you hasanadiguzel!

As in all my other aide-mémoire projects, the point of this one is to help me remember how to use the API and use it as a resource available from any computer without a build.
